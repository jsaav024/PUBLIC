  ### Contextual Analysis

  * Key business objectives and challenges:
       * The main challenge faced by this organization is determining the root cause of employee turnover in the realm of middle management. This requires addressing several key metric that may include satisfaction survey results, exit interview results, internal communications as well as any policy changes.
       * Factors that may influence data  would include context of surveys. For example, how frequent are these surveys being sent out? Are the surveys required or optional? Do we have only content employees who are responding or are the majority of the surveys expressing negative feedback. This information is not explicitly found in the raw data but must be placed in the context of the organization and its policies. Other factors may be related to salary/income within the organization for this role compared to industry benchmarks. We must also obtain historical data to compare with current data as the current data may have been impacted external factors such as the recent pandemic or shifts in the economy.
       * Therefore, one hypothetical cause/insight would be dissatisfaction within the company for fiscal reasons and this may be possibly be overlooked by not having accurate measures through the surveys being sent out. This would require a tighter schedule with sending out surveys in a more uniform manner.  
   
### Mini Data Story


A proposed solution to this prior to externally hiring new managers is to mitigate any further loss or turnover. Using the data we've acquired, we would need to ensure that all employee incentives are kept up with industry standards. Furthermore, internal career development and promotion from within the organization is something that may boost retention, prevent loss and present newer staffing opportunities for more entry-level roles. Addressing these initial turnovers as a first step would fill any gap left behind by previous managers
